* Stylized, satirical, Agile-themed
* Pulls from randomized character roles, archetypes, or user input

* Optional connection to mood input

### ✍️ Punchline Engine

* Taglines or one-liners like:

    * "You thought you pointed the ticket, but the ticket pointed you."
    * "The sprint ends. The sprint begins."
    * "Not every ticket needs a solution. Some need a eulogy."

---

## Core Archetypes / Characters

* 🙀 **Lee** – the unknowable, cursed legend
* 🧼 **The Scrub Maiden** – confused for Soap, but spiritually correct
* 🧽 **Soap Maestro** – polisher of the unpointed
* 😱 **The Intern** – holder of ancient truths
* 💼 **The PO** – Product Oracle
* 🍜 **El. Sukuramu Masuta** – hybrid mythic scrum master
* 🌀 **The Sprint Whisperer** – knows when sprints never truly end

## 🏁 The Amazing Sprint (Race) Modules

*“Only one ticket survives.”*

### 🟩 Leg 1: The Estimation Gauntlet

Teams must guess the SP of legacy tickets based only on cryptic Git history and a Confluence emoji: \[🧼].

### 🟦 Leg 2: Merge or WWJD (What Would Jira Do)

Must merge a 243-comment PR before lunch or it merges itself onto main, linked to your name and Jira ticket.

### 🟥 Detour: “Scrub Maiden” vs “Soap Maestro” vs “El Sukuramu Masuta”

Choose your chaos:

* **Scrub Maiden**: Polish 28 tickets stuck in QA limbo. (She still thinks it was Stunt Mason.)
* **Soap Maestro**: Buff your way through legacy UX feedback from 2019.
* **El Sukuramu Masuta**: Convince a multilingual, cross-cultural backlog that sprints are real.

### 🟨 Roadblock: “In It, Lee.”

One team member must explain who Lee is, what he meant, and why ticket keys now render upside down.
Only then may they proceed to Retro Station, where everyone’s past sprint sins are read aloud.
